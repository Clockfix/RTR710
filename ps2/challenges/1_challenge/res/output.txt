IN ITS EARLIEST DAYS, PRODUCTIVITY WAS LARGELY LIMITED TO AGRICULTURE -- THAT IS, THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF FOOD. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AROUND THAT TIME, RURAL POPULATIONS VASTLY OUTNUMBERED THOSE IN URBAN AREAS, SUGGESTING THAT FEWER PEOPLE WERE DEDICATED TO NON-AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY.
ON TOP OF THAT, PRIOR TO THE 1800S, FOOD PRESERVATION WAS, AT MOST, ARCHAIC. AFTER ALL, REFRIGERATION WASN'T REALLY AVAILABLE UNTIL 1834, WHICH MEANT THAT CROPS HAD TO BE CONSUMED FAST, BEFORE THEY SPOILED. THERE WAS LITTLE ROOM FOR SURPLUS, AND THE FOCUS WAS MAINLY ON SURVIVAL. THE IDEA OF "GETTING STUFF DONE" DIDN'T REALLY EXIST YET, SUPPRESSING THE IDEA OF PRODUCTIVITY.
IT WAS SHORTLY BEFORE THE 19TH CENTURY THAT TO-DO LISTS BEGAN TO SURFACE, AS WELL. IN 1791, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN RECORDED WHAT WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST-KNOWN FORMS OF IT, MOSTLY WITH THE INTENTION OF CONTRIBUTING SOMETHING OF VALUE TO SOCIETY EACH DAY -- THE LIST OPENED WITH THE QUESTION, "WHAT GOOD SHALL I DO THIS DAY?"
THE ITEMS ON FRANKLIN'S LIST SEEMED TO INDICATE A SHIFT IN FOCUS FROM SURVIVAL TO COMPLETING DAILY TASKS -- THINGS LIKE "DINE," "OVERLOOK MY ACCOUNTS," AND "WORK." IT WAS ALMOST A PRECURSOR TO THE U.S. INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEGUN WITHIN THE FIRST TWO DECADES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. THE NEW YORK STOCK & EXCHANGE BOARD WAS OFFICIALLY ESTABLISHED IN 1817, FOR EXAMPLE, SIGNALING BIG CHANGES TO THE IDEA OF TRADE -- SOCIETY WAS DRIFTING AWAY FROM THE SINGULAR GOAL OF SURVIVAL, TO BROADER ASPIRATIONS OF MONETIZATION, CONVENIENCE, AND SCALE.
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION ACTUALLY BEGAN IN GREAT BRITAIN IN THE MID-1700S, AND BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF EXISTENCE IN THE U.S. IN 1794, WITH THE INVENTION OF THE COTTON GIN -- WHICH MECHANICALLY REMOVED THE SEEDS FROM COTTON PLANTS. IT INCREASED THE RATE OF PRODUCTION SO MUCH THAT COTTON EVENTUALLY BECAME A LEADING U.S. EXPORT AND "VASTLY INCREASED THE WEALTH OF THIS COUNTRY," WRITES JOSEPH WICKHAM ROE.
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS IN A SOCIETAL STEP TOWARD AUTOMATION -- TO REQUIRE LESS HUMAN LABOR, WHICH OFTEN SLOWED DOWN PRODUCTION AND RESULTED IN SMALLER OUTPUT. NOTICE IN THE TABLE BELOW THAT, BEGINNING IN 1880, MACHINERY ADDED THE GREATEST VALUE TO THE U.S. ECONOMY. SO FROM THE INVENTION OF THE COTTON GIN TO THE 1913 UNVEILING OF FORD'S INAUGURAL ASSEMBLY LINE (NOTE THAT "AUTOMOTIVE" WAS ADDED TO THE TABLE BELOW IN 1920), THERE WAS A COMMON GOAL AMONG THE MANY ADVANCES OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION: TO PRODUCE MORE IN -- YOU GUESSED IT -- LESS TIME.
ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY -- AND THE RESULTING HIGHER RATE OF PRODUCTION -- MEANT MORE EMPLOYMENT WAS BECOMING AVAILABLE IN INDUSTRIAL SECTORS, REDUCING THE AGRICULTURAL WORKFORCE. BUT PEOPLE MAY HAVE ALSO BECOME BUSIER, LEADING TO THE INVENTION AND SALE OF CONSUMABLE SCHEDULING TOOLS, LIKE PAPER DAY PLANNERS.
ACCORDING TO THE BOSTON GLOBE, THE RISING POPULARITY OF DAILY DIARIES COINCIDED WITH INDUSTRIAL PROGRESSION, WITH ONE OF THE EARLIEST KNOWN TO-DO LISTS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE -- THE WANAMAKER DIARY -- DEBUTING IN THE 1900S. CREATED BY DEPARTMENT STORE OWNER JOHN WANAMAKER, THE PLANNER'S PAGES WERE INTERSPERSED WITH PRINT ADS FOR THE STORE'S CATALOGUE, ACHIEVING TWO NEWLY COMMERCIAL GOALS: HELPING AN INCREASINGLY BUSIER POPULATION PLAN ITS DAYS, AS WELL AS ADVERTISING THE GOODS THAT WOULD HELP TO MAKE LIFE EASIER.
BUT THERE WAS A DISRUPTION TO PRODUCTIVITY IN THE 1900S, WHEN THE U.S. ENTERED WORLD WAR I, FROM APRIL 1917 TO THE WAR'S END IN NOVEMBER 1918. BETWEEN 1918 AND AT LEAST 1920 BOTH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND THE LABOR FORCE SHRANK, SETTING THE TONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS OF ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. THE STOCK MARKET GREW QUICKLY AFTER THE WAR, ONLY TO CRASH IN 1929 AND LEAD TO THE 10-YEAR GREAT DEPRESSION. SUDDENLY, THE FOCUS WAS ON SURVIVAL AGAIN, ESPECIALLY WITH THE U.S. ENTRANCE INTO WORLD WAR II IN 1941.
THE GROWING PRESENCE OF WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE HAD MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WAY PRODUCTIVITY IS THOUGHT OF TODAY. STARTING NO LATER THAN 1948 -- THREE YEARS AFTER WORLD WAR II'S END -- THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE ONLY CONTINUED TO GROW, ACCORDING TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR.
THAT SUGGESTS LARGER NUMBERS OF WOMEN WERE STEPPING AWAY FROM FULL-TIME DOMESTIC ROLES, BUT MANY STILL HAD CERTAIN DEMANDS AT HOME -- BY 1975, FOR EXAMPLE, MOTHERS OF CHILDREN UNDER 18 MADE UP NEARLY HALF OF THE WORKFORCE. THAT CREATED A NEWLY UNMET NEED FOR CONVENIENCE -- A WAY TO FULFILL THESE DEMANDS AT WORK AND AT HOME.
ONCE AGAIN, A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION WAS STRAPPED FOR TIME, BUT HAD INCREASING RESPONSIBILITIES. THAT CREATED A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR CERTAIN INDUSTRIES TO PRESENT NEW SOLUTIONS TO WHAT WAS A NEARLY 200-YEAR-OLD PROBLEM, BUT HAD BEEN REFRAMED FOR A MODERN CONTEXT. AND IT BEGAN WITH FOOD PRODUCTION.
